a hall in the royal palace at memphis
(left and right, a colonnade decorated with statues
and flowering shrubs. rear, a great door beyond which
can be seen temples, the palaces of memphis and the
pyramids.)

ramfis
yes, it is rumoured that the ethiopian has dared
to challenge us again, threatening
thebes and the valley of the nile. shortly
a messenger will bring us the details.

radam?s
have you consulted
holy isis?

ramfis
she has named
the supreme commander
of the egyptian armies.

radam?s
oh, fortunate man!

ramfis (looking steadily at radam?s, meaningfully)
he is young and brave. now i shall go
to inform the king of the deity’s decree.
(ramfis goes out.)

radam?s (solo)
if only that warrior were i!
if my dream might come true!
an army of brave men, led by me ?
victory, and the applause of all memphis!
to return to you, my sweet aida,
decked with the victor’s laurels,
to say. “i fought, i won for you!”
heavenly aida, divine form,
mystic garland of light and flowers,
you are the queen of my thought,
you are the splendour of my life.
that i might bring you once more
the blue skies, the soft breezes of your native land,
a royal crown to deck your brow,
a royal throne for you, in the sun!
oh, heavenly aida, divine form,
mystic halo of light and flowers,
you are the queen, etc.
(amneris enters.)

amneris
what rare joy shines
on your face! what noble pride
flashes in your eyes!
how enviable indeed
would be that woman whose beloved face
might kindle so joyful a light in you!

radam?s
my heart was lost
in an adventurous dream. today the goddess
has named the warrior who will lead
the egyptian legions into battles. ah! if i were
chosen for such an honour...

amneris
was it not perhaps
some greater, sweeter dream
which spoke to your heart? have you
no desires, no hopes, here in memphis?

radam?s
i! (what an interrogation!
perhaps she has discovered
the secret love which burns in my heart...
perhaps she has read in my thoughts
her slave-girl’s name!)

amneris
(oh, woe if love for another
should burn in his heart!
woe to him if my eyes
should see through this fatal mystery!)

radam?s (seeing aida)
it is she!

amneris (to herself)
he is moved! the glance
with which he looked at her!
aida! could it be she
who is my rival?

(turning to aida)
come, my child, come near me.
you are neither slave nor handmaiden
here, where for love of you
i have called you sister. you weep?
tell me the reason for your tears,
tell me your secret.

aida
alas, i have heard
the frightful war cry sounds,
i fear for my country,
for myself, for you.

amneris
is this true? no greater care
disturbs you?
(aside, looking at aida)
ah! tremble, evil slave, tremble!
let me sound your heart!
tremble, for the truth is clear to me
when i see your tears, your blushes!

radam?s (aside, looking at amneris)
in her face, anger
and suspicion blaze like a fire.
woe if our secret love
she should ever read in our hearts!

aida (to herself)
no, not only for my country
is my heart in anguish;
the tears i shed are the tears
of unhappy love!

(the king enters, preceded by his guard and followed
by ramfis, ministers, priests, officers and others.)

the king
high reasons of state have led me
to summon you, o faithful egyptians.
a messenger has arrived
from ethiopia. he brings grave tidings.
hear them now.
(to an officer)
let the messenger come forward.
(the messenger enters.)

messenger
the sacred soil of egypt has been invaded
by the fierce ethiopian.
our fields have been laid waste,
our crops burned.
spurred on by this easy victory, the foe
is marching now on thebes.

all
they dare to do this!

messenger
a fierce, relentless warrior heads them ?
amonasro!

all
the king himself!

aida (to herself)
my father!

messenger
thebes, already in arms, will fall
upon the barbarian invader from her hundred
gates, spreading war and death.

the king
yes! let war and death
be our battle cry!

all
war! war! etc.
tremendous, pitiless war!

the king (coming near to radam?s)
holy isis
has already named the leader
of our invincible legions:
radam?s!

all
radam?s!

radam?s
ah! praised be the gods!
my prayers are answered!

amneris (to herself)
he, the leader!

aida (to herself)
i am afraid!

ministers and captains
radam?s! radam?s!

the king
go now, o warrior,
to the temple of vulcan. there put on
the sacred arms; go forth to victory!
onward! go forth, egyptian heroes,
to the sacred banks of the nile.
from every heart let the cry sound out ?
war and death, death to the invader!

ramfis
glory to the gods! let all remember,
it is they who rule our destinies.
only the power of the gods
can dictate the warrior’s fate.
let all remember that only the power, etc.

ministers and captains
onward! may our breasts be a fortress
shielding the sacred banks of the nile.
let no cry sound but our united cry,
war, war and death to the invader! etc.

the king
go forth, egyptian heroes, etc.

aida (to herself)
for whom do i weep? for whom do i pray?
what power binds be to him?
i must love him, yet he is,
the enemy of my country!

radam?s
a sacred thrill of glory
runs through my heart.

onward, let us hasten to victory!
war and death to the invader!

amneris
(bearing a banner which she presents to radam?s)
accept, o leader, from my hands
this glorious banner;
may it be as a light and a guide
on the road to victory.

the king
onward, egyptian heroes, etc.

ramfis and
priests
glory to the gods, etc.

ministers and captains
onward! may our breasts, etc.

radam?s,
messenger
onward, let us hasten to victory, etc.

amneris
may it be as a light, etc.

all
war! war! etc.
death to the invader, etc.

amneris
return victorious!

all
return victorious!
(they all leave, except aida.)

aida
return victorious! my lips have spoken
the traitorous words! victorious
over my father, who takes up arms
for me, to give me again
a country, a kingdom and a great name,
which here i must hide. victorious
over my brothers ? that i may see him,
stained with the beloved blood, welcomed
in triumph by egypt! and behind
his chariot, a king. my father, in chains!
my mad word,
o gods, efface!
send back this child
to her father’s heart.
destroy the legions
of our oppressors!
wretched girl, what have i said? and my love?
can i, then, forget
this burning love, which, as a wretched slave,
i welcome in rapture like a ray of the sun?
shall i invoke death
upon radam?s, him whom i love so much?
ah, never on earth
has a broken heart known such anguish!
the sacred words father and lover ?
i can no longer speak them, nor remember.
for each, in my fear and confusion,
i should like to pray, to weep.
but my prayer changes to cursing ?
tears, for me, are criminal; so too my sighs.
my mind is lost in a bitter night,
and in such cruel anguish i wish to die.

oh! gods, have pity on my suffering!
there is no hope for my sorrow!
fatal love, fearful love,
break my heart and let me die!
oh! gods, have pity on my suffering! etc.

a room in the apartments of amneris
(amneris is surrounded by slaves girls, who are dressing
her for the victory celebration. incense is burning in
censers swung from tripods. youthful moorish slaves
dance about her as they wave great feather fans.)

slave-girls
o hero, who, to the sounds of hymns and praise,
set forth on the flight to glory,
like some god of terror,
blazing like the sun,
come, on your head shall shower
the blossoms won from the laurel,
and together the songs of glory
shall sound with the songs of love.

amneris (to herself)
ah, come, my love, bring madness
and blessed peace to my heart!

slave-girls
now where are the barbaric hordes
of the mighty invader?
like mist, they faded away
at the first breath of our champion.
come, victorious warrior,
come take the prize of glory;
victory has smiled upon you,
on you love too shall smile.

amneris (to herself)
ah, come, my love, give new life to me, once more,

amneris
ah, come, my love, etc.
silence! aida is coming.
child of the vanquished, grief is sacred.
(at a sign from amneris, all withdraw.)
seeing her now, the fearful
doubt awakens in me again ?
now i shall penetrate this fatal secret!
(to aida, with feigned tenderness)
the fortunes of war have gone against
your people! poor aida!
your heart’s grief i share with you.
i am your friend. you shall have
whatever you wish from me. you shall be happy.

aida
can i be happy,
far from my homeland,
knowing nothing of the fate
of my father and my brothers?

amneris
i weep for you. but there are limits
to earthly sorrow. time will quiet
the anguish of your heart ?
and, more than time, a powerful god ?
love!

aida (to herself)
love, love! tormenting joy,
sweet rapture, cruel anxiety!
in thy sorrow i find my life,
in thy smile, i find heaven itself.
in thy sorrow, etc.

amneris (to herself)
ah, her pallor, her confusion
betray the secret fever of love!
i fear to question her,
for i share the anxiety of her heart!
(to aida)
what new anguish
disturbs you, sweet aida?
tell me your secret,
trust in my friendship.
among those brave men who fought
and conquered your homeland,
was there perhaps one
whom you loved?

aida
what do you mean?

amneris
not to all
has fate been cruel,
since our fearless leader
has died on the battlefield ?

aida
what did you say? oh! wretched!

amneris
yes, radam?s was killed by your people...

aida
alas!

amneris
and can you weep?

aida
i shall never cease my weeping!

amneris
the gods have avenged you!

aida
the gods have always been against me.

amneris
tremble! i have read your heart ?
you love him ?

aida
i!

amneris
do not lie!
one more word and i shall know.
look into my eyes, i deceived ?
radam?s alive!

aida
alive!
oh, praised be the gods!

amneris
and you still hope to lie to me?
yes, you love him!
but i too love him, do you hear?
i am your rival, i, daughter of the pharaohs!

aida
my rival! then so be it,
for i too am ?
ah, what am i saying?
have pity on me; forgive me, ah!
let pity for my sorrow move you.
it is true, i love him deeply.
you are happy, you are powerful,
in my life there is nothing but my love! etc.

amneris
fear me now, you slave!
let your heart break;
this love can mean your death.
i am master of your fate,
and my heart rages with hate and vengeance!

you are happy, etc.

aida
ah, have pity! what is left for me?
my life is a desert.
live, reign ? soon
i shall appease your anger.
this love which distresses you
will die with me, in the tomb.

amneris
come, follow me. you shall see
if you are worthy to do battle with me, etc.

amonasro
her father, i too fought.
we were conquered. i sought death in vain.
(indicating his uniform)
this uniform is witness
that i defended my king and my country.
fate was our enemy,
our courage was in vain.
in the dust at my feet
lay my king, dead of his wounds.
if love of one’s country is a crime,
then we are all guilty, and ready to die.
(turning to the king, in a pleading voice)
but you, o king, are a mighty lord.
look with mercy on these captives.
today we are laid low by fate:
tomorrow, such might be your lot.

o king, you swore in the name of the gods,
and by the splendour of your crown.
you swore to grant me my wish.

encouraged by our mercy,
they will take up arms again!

radam?s
if amonasro, the warrior king, is dead,
they can no longer hope to fight us.

ramfis
at least,
as a pledge of peace, let aida,
with her father, remain with us.

the king
i yield to your good counsel.
and now i give you a greater
pledge of peace;
radam?s, the fatherland owes everything to you.
the hand of amneris shall be you reward.
one day, with her,
you shall rule over egypt.

the goddess’s favour on the eve
of your wedding. isis reads

yes, i shall pray that radam?s give me
his whole heart, as my heart is given
in sacred love, forever, to him.

aida
radam?s will come here. what will he say?
i tremble. ah! if you come, cruel man,
to bid me a last farewell,
in the dark eddies of the nile i shall find
my tomb, perhaps peace ? but at least, oblivion!
o fatherland, i shall never see you again!
o blue skies, soft breezes of my homeland,
where i lived out the quiet morning of my life,
o grassy hills, o fragrant streams,

o fatherland, i shall never see you again! etc.
o cool valleys, blessed, peaceful haven,
one day promised me by love,
now that the dream of love is gone,
o fatherland, i shall never see you again! etc.
(amonasro enters.)
heaven! my father!

amonasro
a grave matter
has brought me here, aida.
nothing escapes my eyes.
love for radam?s is killing you.
he loves you too. you are waiting for him.
the daughter of the pharaohs is your rival ?
princess of a hated race, our deadly enemy.

aida
and i am in her power!
i, the daughter of amonasro!

amonasro
in her power!
no! if you wish,
you can defeat your powerful rival,
and fatherland, throne and love will all be yours.
you will see again our fragrant forests,
the cool valleys and the golden temples.

aida
1 shall see again our fragrant forests,
the cool valleys and the golden temples.

amonasro
happy bride of the one you love,
you shall know great joys at last.

aida
one day of such enchantment,
one hour of such great joy ? then i can die!

amonasro
you have not forgotten that pitiless egypt
defiled our altars, temples and homes,
carrying off our maidens in slavery,
murdering our mothers, our old men and out
children?

aida
ah, i remember well those unhappy days,
and the mournful sorrow which filled my heart!
ah, grant, o gods, that for us may return
the dawn of this peaceful days for which we pray.

amonasro
remember...
it cannot be long delayed.
our people even now are ready for battle;
all is prepared, and we shall conquer.
one thing is lacking ? for me to know
the route that the enemy will follow.

aida
who could find out? who?

amonasro
you could!

aida
i!

amonasro
i know you are waiting for radam?s. he loves you.
he is the egyptian captain.
do you understand?

aida
a horrid thought!
what are you asking of me? no, never!

amonasro (fiercely)
arise then
soldiers of egypt!
sack and burn
our cities!
spread terror,
rape and death!
there is no rein now
to your fury!

aida
ah, father! father!

amonasro (repulsing her)
you call yourself my daughter!

aida
have pity!

amonasro
waves of blood are flowing
over the vanquished cities.
see ? from the black swirls

the dead arise.
they point at you and cry,
“because of you, our country dies!”

aida
have pity! father, have pity!

amonasro
a horrid spectre
rises in the shadows before us.
tremble, for over your head
it lifts its bony arms.
it is your mother ? see her,
she is cursing you!

aida (terrified)
ah! father! no! have pity! etc.

amonasro (repulsing her)
you are not my daughter!
you are the slave of the pharaohs!

aida
ah! have pity! have pity!
father, i am not their slave.
do not curse me nor revile me ?
you will call be daughter again,
for i shall be worthy of my country.

amonasro
remember that a whole people, conquered
and suffering, can rise again through you!

aida
o fatherland, what a price i must pay, for thee!

amonasro
be brave! he is coming now. i shall hear all.
(he hides among the palms. radam?s enters.)

radam?s
at last i am with you, again, sweet aida.

aida
stop go away! what do you want from me?

radam?s
it is love which brings me to you.

aida
but the rites of another love await you.
married to amneris ?

radam?s
what are you saying?
you, aida, are the only one i can love.
as the gods are my witness, you shall be mine.

aida
do not break your oath! as a hero
i loved you, if you swear false, i cannot.

radam?s
do you doubt my love, aida?

aida
but how can you escape from amneris’ wiles,
from the king’s command, from the people’s will,
from the wrath of the priests?

radam?s
hear me, aida
ethiopia has awakened,
eager for fierce, new battles.
your people have already invaded,
and i shall lead the egyptians again.
then, in the midst of the triumph,
kneeling before the king, i shall open my heart.
you shall be my victor’s wreath;
and we shall live, blessed by undying love.

aida
and do you not fear
amneris’s wrath? her vengeance,
like a thunderbolt,
will strike me, my father and my people.

radam?s
i shall defend you.

aida
it would be in vain.
yet, if you love me, there is still
an escape for us.

radam?s
what is it?

aida
to flee ?

radam?s
to flee!

aida
let us flee from the scorching sun
of this desert land.
a new fatherland
reveals itself to our love.
there, in the virgin forests,
fragrant with sweet flowers,
we shall forget the world
in blessed joy.

radam?s
you asked me to flee with you
to a foreign land?
to abandon my fatherland
and the altars of our gods?
this land where i first plucked
the flowers of glory,
this land where first we loved ?
how can we forget it?

aida
there, in the virgin forest, etc.

radam?s
the land where we loved, etc.

aida
beneath my country’s freer skies
it will be granted to us to love.
there, in the same temples
we shall worship the same gods, etc.

radam?s
to abandon my fatherland etc.

aida
let us flee ?

radam?s (hesitating)
aida!

aida
you do not love me ? go!

radam?s
not love you!
no man, no god
has ever burned with such a love!

aida
go, go ? amneris is waiting for you at the altar ?

radam?s
no, never!

aida
never, you say?
then the headman’s axe will fall
on me, on my father ?

radam?s
ah no! let us flee together.
yes, let us flee, far from these walls,
let us flee, together, to the desert.
here there is nothing but misfortune,
there we shall find a heaven of love,
the never ending desert
will be our wedding-bed,
the stars will shine upon us
with a purer, brighter light!

aida
in the happy land
of my fathers, heaven awaits us.
there the breeze blows sweet
over that perfumed land of flowers.
cool valleys and green fields
will be our wedding-bed.
the stars will shine upon us
with a purer, brighter light!

aida and
radam?s
come with me, we shall flee together,
from this land of sorrow.
come with me, i love you,
and love shall be our king.

aida
but tell me ? how can we avoid
the egyptian legions?

radam?s
the route by which my men
will march against the enemy
will be free until tomorrow.

aida
and that route is?

radam?s
the pass of napata.
(amonasro comes forward.)

amonasro
the pass of napata!
my men will be there!

radam?s
who has overheard us?

amonasro
aida’s father, the king of the ethiopians!

radam?s (excitedly)
you ? amonasro! you ? the king! o gods!
what have i done?
no, it cannot be, it cannot be!
i dream, i am raving mad!

aida
ah no! be calm. listen to me,
trust my love.

amonasro
aida’s love for you
will build you a throne!

radam?s
i am dishonoured! dishonoured!
for you i have betrayed my country!

aida
be calm!

amonasro
no! you are not guilty,
it was the will of fate.

radam?s
i am dishonoured!

aida
ah, no!

radam?s
for you i have betrayed my country!

amonasro
no: you are not guilty.

aida
be calm...

amonasro
come ? beyond the nile
my brave and faithful men are waiting.
there, love shall fulfil
the wishes of your, heart.
come!
(amneris, ramfis, the priests and guards come out
from the temple.)

amneris
traitor!

aida
my rival!

amonasro
(throwing himself upon amneris with drawn dagger)
you have come to defeat my plans.
you shall die!
act four

scene one

a hall in the king’s palace
(left, a great door leading to the underground
judgement chamber. a passage, right, leads to
radam?s cell.)

amneris
(sadly, standing before the door)
my hated rival has escaped.
radam?s awaits, from the hands
of the priests, the traitor’s punishment.
but he is not a traitor,
even if he revealed the secret plan.

he meant to flee ? with her!
traitors all! death to them ? death!
oh, what am i saying? i love him,
i still love him, with a mad, a desperate
love, which is killing me.
oh! if only he might love me!
i should like to save him. how? i shall try!
guards, bring radam?s to me.
(radam?s enters escorted by guards.)
the priests even now are in counsel,
deciding you fate.
but you can still establish your innocence
in answer to the dread accusations.
clear yourself, and i shall ask
pardon for you from the king.
in that way, i can bring
both pardon and life you.

radam?s
the judges shall never hear me
try to defend myself.
before the gods and man
i feel myself neither traitors no guilty.
my incautious words
revealed the secret, it is true.
but both my thought
and my honour remain unstained by guilt.

amneris
then defend yourself ? save yourself.

radam?s
no.

amneris
you will die ?

radam?s
life
is hateful to me. the source
of all joy is now dry,
every hope is gone.
i wish only to die.

amneris
to die! ah, you must live!
yes, you shall live in my love.
for you, i have already felt
the horrible anguish of death.
i loved, i suffered,
i passed the nights in tears.
my country, my throne, my life ?
i should give up all for you.

radam?s
for her, i too betrayed
my country and my honour.

amneris
do not speak of her!

radam?s
infamy
is my lot ? and you ask me to live?
you brought me to the depths of misery,
you took aida from me.
perhaps, because of you, she is dead ?
and you offer me my life?

amneris
aida dead, because of me?
no, she is alive!

radam?s
she is alive!

amneris
in the desperate flight
of the fleeing hordes
only her father died.

radam?s
and she?

amneris
she disappeared,
nothing is known of her.

radam?s
may the gods lead her
safely to her home.
may she never know the fate
of the one who will die for her!

amneris
if i save you, swear to me
that you will never see her again.

radam?s
i cannot!

amneris
if you renounce her
forever, you will live!

radam?s
i cannot!

amneris
once more ?
renounce her.

radam?s
it is in vain.

amneris
madman ? you insist on dying?

radam?s
i am ready to die!

amneris
who will save you, wretch,
from the fate which awaits you?
you have changed into hatred
a love which had no equal.
only heaven
can now avenge my tears, etc.

radam?s
death is the greatest good,
if i may die for her;
in going to meet my fate
my heart will know great joy;
i have no fear of mortal wrath,
your pity is the only thing i fear, etc.

amneris
ah, who will save him?...
only heaven, etc.

(radam?s goes out, surrounded by guards.)

amneris (she falls desolately into a chair)
alas! i shall die!
oh, who will save him?
and it was i who cast him
into their hands! now i curse
my jealously, which brought his death
and eternal mourning in my heart!
(she turns and sees the priests, who are going down
into radam?s’s underground prison.)
ah, there they are ?
the pitiless ministers of death!
oh, may i not see them, these white-robed ghouls!
(she covers her face with her hands.)
and it was i who cast him
into their hands! etc.

ramfis and
priests (in the vault)
spirit of the gods, descend upon us!
let thy eternal ray enlighten us;
let our lips pronounce thy justice.

amneris
o gods, take pity on my anguished heart!
he is innocent ? save him, o gods!
my grief is desperate, overwhelming!

ramfis and
priests
spirit of the gods, etc.

amneris
oh, who will save him? i shall die!

(radam?s, surrounded by guards is led into the vault.
amneris, seeing him, cries out.)

ramfis (in the vault)
radam?s! radam?s! radam?s!
you revealed
your country’s secrets to the enemy!
defend yourself.

priests
defend yourself.

ramfis
he is silent.

all
traitor!

amneris
ah, pity! he is innocent! pity! o gods!

ramfis
radam?s! radam?s! radam?s!
you deserted
your command on the eve of battle.
defend yourself.

priests
defend yourself.

ramfis
he is silent.

all
traitor!

amneris
ah, pity! ah, save him! pity, o gods!

ramfis
radam?s! radam?s! radam?s!
you betrayed
your country, your king, your honour.
defend yourself.

priests
defend yourself.

ramfis
he is silent.

all
traitor!

amneris
ah, pity! ah, save him! pity, o gods!

ramfis and
priests
radam?s, your fate is decided;
you shall die a traitor’s death.
beneath the altar of the offended god,
you, living, shall be entombed.

amneris
entombed alive! oh, the villains!
their thirst for blood is never appeased ?
yet they call themselves heaven’s ministers!

ramfis and
priests
traitor!

amneris
(assailing the priests as they come up from the vault)
priests ? you have committed a crime!
infamous, bloodthirsty beasts ?
you outrage the gods and man,
punishing the innocent!

ramfis and
priests
he is a traitor! he shall die.

amneris (to ramfis)
priest, this man whom you send to death,
you know well, i once loved.
the curse of a broken heart,
together with his blood, will fall upon you!
you outrage the gods, etc.
ah, he is no traitor...have mercy, etc.

ramfis and
priests
he is a traitor! he shall die.
(they go out slowly.)

amneris
impious brood! my curse upon you!
heaven’s vengeance will strike you!

scene two

interior of the temple of vulcan and ramad?s’s tomb
(the scene is divided into two levels. the upper part
represents the interior of the temple of vulcan,
resplendent with gold and light; the lower lever, a
vault. long rows of arches disappear into the darkness.
colossal statues of osiris, with crossed hands, hold up
the pilasters of the vault. radam?s is seated on the
steps by which he has descended into the vault. above,
two priests are carefully replacing the stone which
seals the vault.)

radam?s
the fatal stone has closed above me.
this is my tomb. never again shall i see
the light of day, nor see aida.
aida ? where are you? may you at least
live happily, never knowing
my horrid fate. a sigh? a ghost,
a vision ? no, this is a human form!
heaven ? aida!

aida
yes, i.

radam?s
you, in this tomb!

aida
in my heart, i sensed your fate.
secretly i came into this tomb
opened to receive you.
and here, far from every human eye,
i have chosen to die with you!

radam?s
to die ? so pure, so lovely!
to die, for love of me!
in the flowering of your youth,
to give up your life!
heaven created you for love,
yet i in loving you have killed you!
no, you shall not die!
i have loved you too much,
you are too lovely to die!

aida (in a delirium)
see? the angel of death,
with shining wings, comes near,
to bear us to eternal joys
upon his golden wings.
above us heaven is opening.
there, every sorrow ends,
and there joy begins,
the joy of immortal love.
(from above are heard the hymns of the priests and
priestesses invoking the gods.)

priests and
priestesses
great phtha, life-giving
spirit of the world, ah!
we invoke thee!

aida
how sad a song!

radam?s
the joy of the priests!

aida
our funeral hymn.

radam?s
(trying to move the stone which closes the vault)
nor does my strength suffice
to move thee, o fatal stone!

aida
it is useless! on earth,
all is finished for us.

radam?s (with sad resignation)
it is true!
(he comes back to aida, to sustain her.)

aida
o earth, farewell ? farewell, vale of tears,
dream of joy which vanished into sorrow.
heaven opens to us, our wandering souls
fly fast towards the light of eternal day, etc.

aida and
radam?s
o earth, farewell, etc.
ah! heaven opens for us, etc.

priests and priestesses
mighty phtha, etc.
(aida sinks into the arms of radam?s. amneris enters<
the temple, dressed in mourning, and prostrates herself
on the stone which seals the vault.)

aida and
radam?s
...o earth, farewell, etc.
heaven opens to us!

amneris
i pray for thy peace...beloved, lifeless body;
may isis, placated, receive you into heaven!

priests and priestesses
mighty phtha!

amneris
peace, i implore of you! peace, peace, peace!

end

radam?s (coming between them)
stop, madman!
amonasro
oh, fury!

ramfis
guards, look out!

radam?s (to aida and amonasro)
quickly! flee!

amonasro (dragging aida)
come, my daughter.

ramfis (to the guards)
after them!

radam?s (to ramfis)
priest, i am in your hands.
